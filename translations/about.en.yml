    a: Sure! If you are a Symfony developer, go to GitHub (linked in the footer), and get involved in the project. If you are a graphist, create a logo, a favicon, or themes for Kyélà. As a mere user, report problems; a detailed description of a reproductible bug makes the fix really easy.

about.confidentiality:
    q: What is the legal frame of kyela.net ?
    a: Kyela.net is hosted in Switzerland, subject to Swiss legislation. It keeps server logs for one year, and must communicate them to the police on legal request. These logs, containing IP addresses, allow them to easily identify the authors. In other words, using kyela.net to plan anything illegal is a terrible idea.
