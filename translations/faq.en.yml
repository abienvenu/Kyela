what.is.kyela:
    q: What is Kyélà?
    a: It is a web application that makes it easier to organize gatherings and conduct opinion polls.
doodle.difference:
    q: What is the difference from Doodle™?
    a: In Kyélà polls, the possible answers are fully customizable (text, color, and icons). Kyélà is completely free (no "premium" version), anonymous, requires no registration, and has no ads. Plus, it's open source, meaning anyone can install a copy of Kyélà on their own server.
how.many.options:
    q: What choices are available to each participant?
    a: Three by default (yes/maybe/no), but these choices can be modified or expanded by clicking "Edit options".
recurrent.events:
    q: How can I manage multiple or recurring events?
    a: A single poll is enough. You just need to propose the upcoming possible events. Past dates are automatically archived (and remain accessible) once the event has passed. It is more convenient to use the same poll throughout the year rather than juggling multiple ones.
short.url:
    q: My poll's web address is too long. Can I get a shorter, easier-to-remember URL?
    a: Yes, you can edit your poll and change the URL. Be careful—if your URL is too easy to guess, uninvited people might find your poll.
how.secure:
    q: How is a poll protected?
    a: Only people with the link can access the poll. There is no index, and search engines do not reference the polls. Make sure to share the link only with the relevant people.
what.permissions:
    q: How do permissions and access restrictions work?
    a: There are none. Everyone can do anything on the poll, making it easier for everyone.
about.vandalism:
    q: Could my poll be vandalized?
    a: If people want to meet, it means they want to collaborate. Otherwise, they probably shouldn't meet!
registration:
    q: Is it possible to create an account or register?
    a: No. It wouldn’t add any benefits and would just make management more complicated.
examples:
    q: What kinds of events can Kyélà be used for?
    a: Organizing meals, association meetings, sports or music gatherings, workshops... In these cases, organizers want to find a date that works for the most people and estimate attendance. Kyélà can also be used for opinion polls by proposing questions instead of dates.
