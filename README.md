Participation polls for group events

Features
--------

* Create one or many polls
* Each poll has a randomized URL; only people who get the link can have access
* Suggest one or many dates
* Customize the choices (text and color), add more choices
* User comments
* Simple usage, no authentication
* Mobile friendly
* No ad, no fee, no spying, just OpenSource

Basic Usage
-----------

* Point your browser to a website hosting the Kyélà application, like http://kyela.net
* Pick a name and click "Create" to create a new poll
* Bookmark the URL of the poll
* Add participants and events
* Share the URL of the poll with your friends via email or chat
* Enjoy!

Server Installation
-------------------

Maybe you want your own private Kyélà server firewalled somewhere to protect your super-secret meetings.
Or Maybe you want to run a customized, cooler version, for your private team of even for the public.
Anyway, your are free to do it in the frame of the AGPL license.

#### Simple Docker container

This is the very simplest way to have Kyélà running, suitable for test or demo purpose:

* Install docker
* Download and run the application :
```bash
$ docker run -d --name kyela -p 8042:80 -e APP_ENV=prod -e APP_SECRET=IAmNotSecret abienvenu/kyela
```
* Point your browser to http://localhost:8042/

After a reboot, you may want to start the application again:
```bash
$ docker start kyela
```

To update the code to the latest Symfony and Kyélà version, run:
```bash
$ docker commit kyela # in case the update goes wrong
$ docker exec kyela composer update
```

NOTE: In this case, all the data lives inside the container, including polls created by your users.
Good point: if you move the container somewhere else, the data goes with it.
However, if you remove the container, the data is DELETED.

#### Docker container with a named volume

Using a named volume is more suitable for production use.

```bash
$ docker volume create --name kyela-data
$ docker run -d --name kyela -p 8042:80 -v kyela-data:/var/www/kyela/data --restart always  -e APP_ENV=prod -e APP_SECRET=IAmNotSecret abienvenu/kyela
```

The named volume can be easily backed up (cf. https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#/backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes).
This technique enables you to pull newer Docker images of the kyela application, remove the old container, and instanciate a new one using the same data volume:
```bash
$ docker pull abienvenu/kyela
$ docker stop kyela
$ docker rm kyela
$ docker run -d --name kyela -p 8042:80 -v kyela-data:/var/www/kyela/data --restart always  -e APP_ENV=prod -e APP_SECRET=IAmNotSecret abienvenu/kyela
```

### Native

Native installation is deprecated, but you can still [try it here](NATIVE_INSTALL.md).

Customisation
-------------

To edit or extend the FAQ or About page, you just have to add entries in Resources/translations/faq.en.yml (or about.en.yml).

For further customisation, you have to edit the templates or the code.
Because of the licence (GNU Affero GPL-3.0), you must publish the modified code as soon as your project is publicly online.
See below how to develop and contribute to the Kyélà project.

Developing
----------

Would you like to tweak Kyélà, trying your very own features ?
You need not install anything but Docker, and mount the code into a running container. Here is how:

* Download the code at https://github.com/abienvenu/Kyela/archive/master.zip
* Unzip it
* Launch the kyela docker image, mounting the directory of the unzipped code:
```bash
$ cd docker && make run-dev
```
* Point your web browser to http://localhost:8042/
* Use your favorite editor to modify the files into the Kyela-master directory, and see the results in your browser

If you use an advanced PHP editor like PHPStorm, you may want to give it access to the vendor directory so it can parse the librairies.
Here is how to get a copy of it:
```bash
$ docker cp kyela-dev:/var/www/kyela/vendor Kyela-master/vendor
```

Contributing
------------

Please share with us any cool feature or improvement you made! All you need is Github account. Then:

* Fork the Kyélà project https://github.com/abienvenu/kyela (see https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
* Clone your fork of the Kyélà project: ```git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Kyela```
* Like in the previous "Developing" section, launch the kyela docker image, with the code mounted:
```bash
$ cd docker && make run-dev
```
* Point your web browser to http://localhost:8042/
* Use your favorite editor to modify the code
* Test your code: ```cd docker && make test```
* Make a pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

Your contribution will be reviewed, and probably merged into the main project.
