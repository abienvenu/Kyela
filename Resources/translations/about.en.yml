about.third.parties:
    q: Are collected information sent to third parties ?
    a: No, except to the French police, on legal request only.
about.confidentiality:
    q: What is the legal frame of kyela.net ?
    a: Kyela.net is hosted in France, subject to French laws. It keeps server logs for one year, and must communicate them to the police on legal request. These logs, containing IP addresses, allow them to easily identify the authors. In other words, using kyela.net to plan anything illegal is a terrible idea.
